This project will require a email address and a password to login to the system, but a master key will be generated upon successful registration and sent to the email provided 

This master key is entered on the users homepage, in which it is stored for that session in a cookie. to be used to decrypt credential records.

For now:
    the password will be the true master key and the key is a fake key that obfuscates information
