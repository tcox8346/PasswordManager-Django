    Shared Information Encryption Field Needs To Be Properly Implemented - UserProfile.key : Credentials.username, password, email ; if type = shared


Friend Functionaility
    Added javascript ajax functionality for template "all_friend_requests.html" focused on accepting and declining friend ship request made to user, and canceling request made by the user
        - This purpose is to have dynamic acceptance/declining without redirection.

            -. Next make a div under the initial friend request page that loads the other friend related pages in div.
